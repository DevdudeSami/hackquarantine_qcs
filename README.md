# Simulating Quantum Computer Circuits in Python
Contains material for my "Simulating Quantum Computer Circuits in Python" workshop presented during HackQuarantine.


The Colab Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Nyn4Q3Zy7eGEJXXqOtKpOtHLGX0fNcsp). To make the best use of this workshop, it is recommeneded to copy this notebook to your Google Drive so you can make changes and write your own circuits.
